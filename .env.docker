# ==============================================================================
# Docker Environment Variables for Nonprofit Fund Accounting Application
# ==============================================================================
# This file defines the environment variables used by the application when
# running inside a Docker container, managed by docker-compose.
# It should be referenced in the 'env_file' section of the docker-compose.yml.

# --- Application Environment ---
# Sets the Node.js environment to 'production' for optimized performance,
# reduced logging, and other production-safe defaults.
NODE_ENV=production

# --- Database Connection Settings ---
# These variables tell the Node.js application how to connect to the
# PostgreSQL database container.

# The hostname of the PostgreSQL database service.
# In Docker Compose, this is the name of the database service defined
# in the docker-compose.yml file (in our case, 'db').
PGHOST=db

# The port the PostgreSQL database is listening on inside the Docker network.
# The default for PostgreSQL is 5432.
PGPORT=5432

# The name of the database to connect to.
# This must match the POSTGRES_DB value in docker-compose.yml.
PGDATABASE=fund_accounting_db

# The username for connecting to the PostgreSQL database.
# This must match the POSTGRES_USER value in docker-compose.yml.
PGUSER=postgres

# The password for the PostgreSQL user.
# This must match the POSTGRES_PASSWORD value in docker-compose.yml.
# For a real production deployment, this should be a more secure, generated password.
PGPASSWORD=npfa123

# --- Application Server Settings ---
# The port the Node.js application will listen on *inside* the container.
# This is then mapped to a host port in the docker-compose.yml file.
PORT=3000
